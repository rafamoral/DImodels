%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
Compute contrasts for Diversity Interactions (DI) models
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
\code{contrast_vars} calculates and tests contrasts using \code{\link[multcomp]{glht}} for a model object created by the \code{\link{DI}} or \code{\link{autoDI}} functions.

\code{contrast_matrix} is a helper function which can be used to prepare a contrast matrix which contains all the ID effects, interactions and additional model variables. The output of this function can then be passed to \code{contrasts_DI} to test contrasts.

\usage{
contrasts_DI(object, contrast_vars, contrast, verbose, ...)

contrast_matrix(object, contrast_vars)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{object}{A model output which is the output of \code{\link{DI}} or \code{\link{autoDI}}.}
  \item{contrast_vars}{A matrix or data-frame containing the values of the species prportions in a contrast style (i.e., positive and negative values). The species ID effects and interactions would be calculated automatically (the value of the non-linear parameter theta would also be incorporated) and added to the contrast. 
  
  The user can also specify any additional variable (like treatment, density) from the model to calculate the contrast at the specific value of that variable(s).
  
  Furthermore, it is also possible to manually specify the ID or interaction effects to have a specific value and override those calculated by the function.
  
  Any species proportion or additional variable not specified would be assumed to be 0. See examples showing the uses of these options.

  Will be overridden if \code{contrast} is specified.}
  \item{contrast}{A data-frame or matrix containing the values for generating the contrast. The number of columns in the matrix/data-frame should be the same as the number of linear coefficients in the model. It is assumed that the columns in \code{contrast} are in the same order as the coefficeints in the model and that the user would calculate the appropriate species interaction values by incorporating the theta value (if it's present) from the model. The matrix/data-frame can also be given row names to track the different contrasts. 
  
                  Recommended only for advanced users who want more control for generating the contrast as most general contrasts can be generated using the \code{contrast_vars} argument. 
    
                  Overrides \code{contrast_vars} if specified.}
  \item{verbose}{A boolean (TRUE/FALSE) value indicating whether to print the internally generated contrast matrix. Default is TRUE}
  \item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the \code{\link[multcomp]{glht}} function}
}
\details{
The contrasts are calculated and tested using the \code{\link[multcomp]{glht}} function in the \code{multcomp} package. If the various contrasts are not explicitly named, they'll be given names `Test 1`, `Test 2`, ..., `Test n`.

## Create contrasts

## 4. Three species equi-proportional mixture (1/3 each) of p2, p3, and p4 against p1 monoculture
## 5. p4 monoculture against a 70-30 mixture of p2 and p3 respectively.
